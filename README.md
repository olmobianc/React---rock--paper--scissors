### Objective

The challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Use JavaScript and React.

### Brief

The challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You can either choose the `original` designs for the simpler version or the `bonus` designs for the harder version. You will find both mobile and desktop versions of the design to work to. Each file is also named depending on which step in the game the design is for. You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

The users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
-   Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
-   Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_
-   **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_

### Rules

If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses one point.
