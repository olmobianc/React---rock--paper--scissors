### Objective

Your challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Use JavaScript and React.

### Brief

Your challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You can either choose the `original` designs for the simpler version or the `bonus` designs for the harder version. You will find both mobile and desktop versions of the design to work to. Each file is also named depending on which step in the game the design is for. You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

Your users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
-   Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
-   Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_
-   **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_

### Rules

If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses one point.

#### Original

-   Rock beats Scissors
-   Scissors beats Paper

#### Bonus

-   Scissors beats Paper
-   Paper beats Rock
-   Rock beats Lizard
-   Lizard beats Spock
-   Spock beats Scissors
-   Scissors beats Lizard
-   Paper beats Spock

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **JavaScript** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainFable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository. **Include a fully built version of your assignment in a folder named public**.

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
